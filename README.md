# Social Distancing
Social Distancing is an open-source project of PAVIS reseach line (https://pavis.iit.it/) for automatically estimating the interpersonal distance from uncalibrated RGB cameras. The software can be freely used for any non-commercial applications to assess and create statiscs over the compliance of safe distances. The code is open and can be improved with your support, please contact us at socialdistancing@iit.it if you want to help us.
